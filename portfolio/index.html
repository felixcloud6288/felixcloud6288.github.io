        <p>My name is Matthew Weston. I'm currently studying Computer Science at UCF. My interests in the field primarily revolve around security, bug-testing, and performance. However I'm also taking some time to learn web design as well. I'm proficient in C, knowledgeable in Java and am starting to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>I began coding on a whim after a friend showed me what it was like and I'm happy to say I've greatly enjoyed it. All the time and effort feel worth it when I run any code and it works. And it always feels great to add to it or make it better.</p>
