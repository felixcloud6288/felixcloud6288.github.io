# portfolio
A work-in-progress portfolio introducing myself to my coding class and potential employers

At the moment, it contains an About, Contacts, and portfolio page.

Contacts is purely visual at the moment. In the future it will be given proper functionality.
Portfolio will be filled as I have actual material to include.
