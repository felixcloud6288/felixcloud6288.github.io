A quiz about web design coding. 

Note: This is not meant to be any actual indicator of user knowledge. This is here for my own practice.

How to Play:
*Click the start button to begin.
*A question and four possible answers will appear on the screen. You have 10 seconds to choose an answer
*Clicking the correct answer will award you points.
*Points are based on how much time is left


TODO:
*Implement the timer
*Implement score
*Add CSS

Plan:
*Store quiz section in a timer-while loop
*buttons will navigate to a separate function that checks if answers are correct or not
*score will be a global


ISSUES:
Timer counts down independently of button presses; must implement in separate functions
